## What should I know before I get started?

### code of conduct

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.
Please report unacceptable behavior to mathsteps@socratic.org

### overview of how (and why) we built mathsteps

- [Read about how and why we built mathsteps on our blog!](https://blog.socratic.org/stepping-into-math-open-sourcing-our-step-by-step-solver-9b5da066ae36)

### mathJS expression trees

- Most of this code iterates over expression trees to make step by step
  simplifications. We use [mathJS expresison trees], which we recommend you
  learn a bit about.
- There are a few different types of nodes that show up in the tree.
  This stepper uses OperationNode, ParenthesisNode, ConstantNode, SymbolNode,
  and FunctionNode. You can also read about them on [the mathJS expressions
  documentation](http://mathjs.org/docs/expressions/expression_trees.html).
- Keep in mind when dealing with these trees that child nodes are called
  different things depending on the parent node type. e.g. operation nodes have
  `args` as their children, and parenthesis nodes have a single child called
  `content`.
- TRICKY catch: any subtraction in the tree will be converted to adding the
  negative, e.g. 2 - 3 would be 2 + -3 in the tree. This is so that all
  addition and subtraction is flat (e.g. 2 + 3 - 5 + 8 would become one
  addition operation with 2, 3, -5, and 8 as its child nodes). This is a common
  strategy for computer algebra systems but can be confusing and easy to forget.
  So at most points in the codebase, there should be no operators with sign `-`
  If you're curious what the code that modifies subtraction looks like, you can
  find it in 'flattenOperands.js'

### Ways to help out

- **You can spread the word!** If you think mathsteps is cool, tell your friends!
  Let them know they can use this and that they can contribute
- **Suggest features!** Have an idea for something mathsteps should solve or a way
  for it to teach math better? If your idea is not an [existing issue](https://github.com/socraticorg/mathsteps/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement), create a new issue with
  the label "enhancement"
- **Report bugs!** If the bug is not an [existing issue](https://github.com/socraticorg/mathsteps/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug),
  create a new issue with the label "bug" and as much detail as you can so
  someone else can reproduce it.
- **Contribute code!** We'd love to have more contributors working on this. Check
  out the section below with more information on how to contribute, and feel
  free to email mathsteps@socratic.org with any questions!

### Creating a pull request

- we're excited to see your [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)!
- if you want to work on something, please comment on the
  [related issue](https://github.com/socraticorg/mathsteps/issues) on GitHub
  before you get started, so others are aware you're working on it
- if there is no existing issue for the change you'd like to make, you can make
  a [new one](https://github.com/socraticorg/mathsteps/issues/new)
- make sure all the unit tests pass (with `npm test`) before creating the
  pull request, and please add your own tests for what you changed as well.
  If you're not sure how to add tests or are confused about why tests are
  failing, it's also fine to create the pull request first and we'll help
  you get things working.

### Testing

- Make sure you properly unit test your changes.
- Run tests with `npm test`
- Install Git hooks with `npm run setup-hooks`. This will add a pre-commit hook which makes sure tests are passing and the code is eslint-compliant.
- If you want to see what the expression tree looks like at any point
  in the code, for debugging, you can log `node` as an expression string
  (e.g. '2x + 5') with `console.log(print(node))`, and you can log the full
  tree structure with `console.log(JSON.stringify(node, null, 2))`

### Coding conventions

- mathsteps follows the node.js code style as described
  [here](https://github.com/felixge/node-style-guide).
- To lint your code, run `npm run lint .`


There's lots to be done, lots of students to help, and we're so glad you'll be
a part of this.

Thanks! ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è
