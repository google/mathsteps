### Existing open source step-by-step solvers

- [PRESS PRolog Equation Solving System](https://github.com/maths/PRESS)

    A computer algebra system for solving symbolic, transcendental,
    non-differential equations. The equations in the PRESS test suite have
    largely been taken from English A-level examination papers from the years
    1971-1979. The system has four different top-level modules: one for solving
    single equations, one for sets of simultaneous equations, one for
    inequalities, and one for proving identities. The procedure for solving
    single equations is the central core of the program. The other top-level
    modules are largely interfaces to the relevant parts of the single equation
    code. (See below for more information on PRESS.)

- [MathPiper](http://mathpiper.org)
    
    A conventional computer algebra system that has been modified to support
    step-by-step mathematics. The step-by-step equation solver in MathPiper
    (which is based on PRESS) has not been officially released yet, so if you
    would like to experiment with it contact [Ted
    Kosan](https://github.com/tkosan).

    solver works:

  simplification is typically used in a CAS.
- PRESS (PRolog Equation Solving System) research papers.

    PRESS was created by a team of researchers lead by Dr. Alan Bundy at the
    University of Edinburgh's Department of Artificial Intelligence during the
    1970s and 1980s. In 2014 Marvin Minsky (who was one of the pioneers of the
    field of artificial intelligence) stated that much of current AI research
    was years behind the AI research that was being done in the 1970s, and the
    PRESS research is a good example of this.
    
    Most of Dr. Bundy's research papers are
    available on his [research outputs website](http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/alan-bundy%28bfb547ed-a4df-4a6c-b1be-8ecd9b13419f%29/publications.html?pageSize=all&page=0).

    HAL 9000 and the Star Trek computer). Doug Lenat (who founded the Cyc
    project in 1984 and who still leads it) recently estimated that Cyc contains
    around 5 percent of the common-sense knowledge a typical human has, but it
    is around 97 percent of the way to accumulating the remaining 95 percent
    automatically because it understands natural language.
