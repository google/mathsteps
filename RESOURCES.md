### Existing open source step-by-step solvers

[MathPiper](mathpiper.org) by [Ted Kosan](https://github.com/tkosan)

- [Video demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy6bwNBkAK0)
- [Solver and rules](https://bitbucket.org/tkosan/mathpiperide/src/67c8b031230bc3fcd9776700487b570ebe62717b/src/library_apps/mathpiper4/src/org/mathpiper/scripts4/steps/?at=master)
 - If you would like to play with the solver and manipulator let Ted know, and
   they will put up instructions on how to use them somewhere.
